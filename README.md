## Just me hacking through the C++ tutorials

i'm learning c++ to become a better programmer overall, please don't judge me based on any of this ;)

also, this is a bit of an experiment on learning a new language. I won't typically go this far "back" to fundamanetals, but I figured I haven't done so since learning Java way back when, so what the hell.

if anyone happens to stumble upon this and would like to offer up some helpful resources or tips, I'd appreciate it!
